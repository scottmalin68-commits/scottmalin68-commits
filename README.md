# 👋 Hi, I'm Scott Malin  
### Cybersecurity Architect • IAM Specialist • Workflow Automation Engineer

I design **deterministic, enterprise‑grade AI frameworks** for Identity, Conditional Access, and security operations. My work focuses on creating **repeatable, auditable, hallucination‑resistant** reasoning systems that help organizations make better decisions with AI.

My background spans **22+ years in security engineering**, endpoint defense, automation, and architectural troubleshooting. Today, I build structured prompt frameworks that behave like **mini‑platforms** — complete with simulation modes, hardening logic, documentation engines, and persona‑based analysis.

## 🔧 What I Build  
I specialize in designing AI systems that support:

- Identity & Access Management (IAM)  
- Conditional Access analysis and simulation  
- Zero Trust alignment  
- Workflow automation  
- Security architecture decision‑making  
- High‑clarity documentation generation  

My repositories form a cohesive suite of tools for security engineers, architects, and analysts.

## 🧭 My Approach  
I design prompts the same way I design security systems:

- **Deterministic logic**  
- **Clear architectural boundaries**  
- **Simulation and validation modes**  
- **Structured outputs**  
- **Zero Trust alignment**  
- **Documentation‑ready formatting**  

AI should behave like a reliable teammate — not a guessing engine.
