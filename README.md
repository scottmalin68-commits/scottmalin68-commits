# 🧭 About Me

I’m a **Cybersecurity and Automation Architect** specializing in:

- Endpoint defense and enterprise security engineering  
- Workflow automation and CI/CD governance  
- Documentation enforcement pipelines  
- PowerShell tooling for diagnostics and security posture  
- AI‑assisted frameworks for clarity, communication, and operational excellence  

My work blends **security rigor**, **automation discipline**, and **presentation quality** — ensuring that every system, script, and workflow is **auditable, deterministic, and professionally documented**.

I build systems that are:
- **Predictable**  
- **Governed**  
- **Self‑documenting**  
- **Reusable**  
- **Recruiter‑ready**
